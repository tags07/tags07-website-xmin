Several points moving randomly in a circle.

This is a solution to the question raised in R-help:
<https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2008-December/183018.html>.

 
```{r demo-a, cache=TRUE, interval=.1}
library(animation)
ani.options(interval = 0.1, nmax = 100)
par(mar = rep(0.5, 4))
BM.circle(cex = 2, pch = 19)
```
