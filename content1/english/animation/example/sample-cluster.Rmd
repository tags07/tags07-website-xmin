Each rectangle stands for a cluster, and the simple random sampling without
replacement is performed for each cluster. All points in the clusters being
sampled will be drawn out.
 
```{r demo-a, cache=TRUE, interval=.5}
library(animation)
ani.options(nmax = 50)
par(mar = rep(1, 4))
sample.cluster(col = c('bisque', 'white'))
```
