So you all know that the package name **xaringan** was from [Sharingan in Naruto](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Sharingan). Sharingan means really, really good eyes. Earlier this month, I stumbled upon [a Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/51120186/559676) on **xaringan**, and was amused after seeing its answer by Yue Jiang. The OP was asking why the slide separator `---` didn't work as expected but generated a horizontal rule instead.

It turned out there was a trailing space after `---`.

Apparently, Yue Jiang (Uchiha?) is a qualified ninja with Sharingan.

That was not the end of the story, though. There was a much longer story behind these three dashes. If you have too much time to kill, you may read through the Github issue [yihui/xaringan#151](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/151).

Once again, we love software. Don't we?

BTW, I believe Emi Tanaka also has Sharingan, since [she discovered](https://twitter.com/statsgen/status/1012664098616590336) the greatest power of `xaringan::inf_mr()` (i.e., the "Infinite Moon Reader"): it preserves the scroll/navigation position when automatically refreshing the page!
