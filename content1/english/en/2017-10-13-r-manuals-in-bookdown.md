Colin Fay [converted all official R manuals to **bookdown**](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay/status/917347006271586304) books, which sounds amazing to me. I suddenly feel these are not the manuals I used to know. I should not judge manuals by appearance, but these manuals with the new styles (borrowed from Gitbook by **bookdown**) actually make me want to read them again.

"I had no idea these manuals existed," [said tj mahr](https://twitter.com/tjmahr/status/917344120896618496).
