This morning I announced [the first **bookdown** contest](https://twitter.com/rstudio/status/1022865820869976065). I wished to launch this contest last year but hadn't had a chance. Basically I was hoping to encourage **bookdown** users to share their templates and examples, so that other people can reuse them. One motivation was writing academic dissertations. I really wish graduate students won't need to waste too much time on formatting their dissertations like I (and presumably many other former students) did. To quote [JuliaStewart Lowndes](https://twitter.com/juliesquid/status/1022941425036664833):

Details about this contest can be found in [this blog post](https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/07/27/first-bookdown-contest/). I'll be looking forward to your submissions in RStudio Community in the next two months.
