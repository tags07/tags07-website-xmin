One thing I fear is a Github issue that never dies --- users keep asking questions under an issue. Sometimes this brings mental fatigue to me: you can check out any time, but you can never leave.

I spent some time on reviewing and modifying Elio's pull request [yihui/knitr#1444](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/pull/1444) yesterday, and finally merged it and documented the new feature. I guess I used up my mental power yesterday. The whole day was spent on several **knitr** issues and pull requests, including this one, as I was hoping to release the next version of **knitr** to CRAN in the near future, which contains two "atom bombs" that I'm very excited about. Today I don't want to work on coding anymore. That is why I'm simply writing blog posts today.

A user [added a question](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/pull/1444#issuecomment-346459014) under the merged pull request. I had a guess on my mind, but didn't want to verify it by myself. Elio did it for me, without me asking him to.

Even better, my guess worked. Thanks, Elio!
