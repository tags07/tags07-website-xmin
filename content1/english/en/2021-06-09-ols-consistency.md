This morning I saw [an interesting tweet by Nick
HK](https://twitter.com/nickchk/status/1402518644542771200), who ran a
simulation to convince himself of the fact that OLS consistency only requires
Corr(X, ε) = 0 but not independence:

I had no doubt about the conclusion, primarily because I had kindly returned
most of the things I learned in the linear models class to the instructor after
I passed the exams more than a decade ago (sorry, [Dr.
Nettleton](https://dnett.github.io)!).

What I found not quite convincing was that Nick only ran the simulation once. A
single estimate of `$\beta$` is not convincing to me to show that the OLS
estimator is consistent, even if its value (2.0014) is fairly close to the true
parameter (2).

BTW, this is off-topic, but usually I'm slightly less convinced about simulation
results obtained from a fixed random seed. Fixing the seed is common practice
for reproducibility, but reproducibility should be independent with the seed
(for random simulations, I think reproducibility "in the ballpark" is more
useful than "digit-to-digit" reproducibility).

## A silly counterexample

If we could conclude consistency from an estimate in one simulation, we would
conclude the same thing by estimating `$\beta$` from the equation
`y = 2 * x + e`, where `e = 0.0014 * x`, which means ε and X are perfectly
correlated:

``` r
x = runif(10000)
e = .0014 * x
y = 2 * x + e  # i.e., y = 2.0014x
lm(y ~ x)
```

Apparently it would not be sensible, even if we get the same estimated value
(2.0014), to conclude that consistency still exists when Corr(X, ε) = 1.

## N needs to increase to illustrate consistency

If I remember correctly, consistency means convergence (of `$\hat{\beta}$` to
`$\beta$`) in probability, as the sample size N increases to infinity. That
means we need to examine the behavior of the estimator as N increases. Below is
a function to estimate the slope of the simple linear regression, with a slight
modification (changing `lm()` to `lm.fit()` for speed) based on Nick's R code:

``` r
beta_est = function(N = 10) {
  e = runif(N)
  x = (e - .5) + 100 * (e - .5)^2 + rnorm(N)
  y = 2 * x + e
  res = lm.fit(cbind(1, x), y)
  res$coefficients[2]  # the slope
}
```

Next we estimate the coefficient 30 times for different sample sizes N = 10,
210, 410, ....

``` r
Ns = rep(seq(10, 15000, 200), each = 30)
bs = numeric(length(Ns))
for (i in seq_along(Ns)) {
  bs[i] = beta_est(Ns[i])
}
```

Last we draw a scatterplot to illustrate how the estimate "converges" to its
true value. Note that is is only an illustration of the overall trend. Of
course, an illustration is not a proof.

``` r
par(mar = c(4, 4.5, .2, .2))
plot(
  Ns, bs, cex = .6, col = 'gray',
  xlab = 'N', ylab = expression(hat(beta))
)
abline(h = 2, lwd = 2)
points(10000, 2.0014, col = 'red', cex = 2, lwd = 2)
arrows(10000, 2.0014, 8000, 1.99, )
text(8000, 1.987, 'Estimate from the simulation
 mentioned in the tweet')
```

I have also marked the value 2.0014 in the plot corresponding to the sample size
10000.

## Does it really converge to the true parameter value?

At the first glance, the estimator appears to be converging indeed. However,
after I marked the true parameter value (again, 2) with a horizontal line in the
plot, it seems that it is converging to a value slightly higher than 2.

I have to remind myself often that *seeing is not believing*. Instead, seeing
can be a good start of thinking. Why does not the estimator appear to converge
to 2? I do not know. I do not even know if I'm talking nonsense in this post (so
now you know that I'm no longer qualified to [be called Dr.
Xie](/en/2017/06/on-formality/)). My intuition is that
`$y \approx 2x + a\sqrt{x} + c$`, where `$a$` is a small constant. I will
appreciate it if anyone could give a rigorous explanation.

**Update on 2021/06/10**: [Nick has given an
explanation](https://twitter.com/nickchk/status/1403185713659539456), which is
quite obvious in hindsight. `X` and `e` are actually correlated in the above
simulation, because `X` contains a linear term `e`, i.e., for
`X = e + 100e^2 + Z`, `e^2` and `Z` are not correlated with `e`, but `e` itself
is certainly correlated with `e`. The correct simulation should be done without
the linear term in `X` (or use `abs(e)`, which is also not correlated with `e`):

``` r
beta_est = function(N = 10) {
  e = runif(N)
  x = 100 * (e - .5)^2 + rnorm(N)
  y = 2 * x + e
  res = lm.fit(cbind(1, x), y)
  res$coefficients[2]  # the slope
}
```
