Sergio Oller sent [a pull request](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/pull/1463) to the **knitr** repo a couple of hours ago to repeat the **longtable** headers in `knitr::kable()`, and he closed it after my comment. I felt a little sorry to reject this pull request (I could see its usefulness), so I appreciated it when he closed it by himself instead of passing the ball to me and letting me close it, otherwise I'd have to struggle a little.

Again, [saying no is hard](/en/2017/11/on-saying-no/), so you are welcome to close the issues you filed or pull requests you opened on Github if you do not really mind.

BTW, I also thank Yadong Liu for closing [yihui/knitr#1313](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/pull/1313).
