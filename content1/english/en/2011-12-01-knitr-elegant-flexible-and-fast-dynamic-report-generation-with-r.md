The world has changed. You can feel it on [GitHub](https://github.com/yihui/knitr). You can smell it on Google+. The **knitr** package, inspired by Sweave, has features that you have been longing for, and features that you might have never imagined. Thumb through [the PDF manual](https://github.com/downloads/yihui/knitr/knitr-manual.pdf) to see some of them.

Currently this package is still a beta version, so I'm looking for feedback from early birds on:

1. Is the PDF documentation confusing in any places? e.g. you have no idea on how to install the package because it was not mentioned in the manual;
1. Does [the website](/knitr) look ugly in your browser? (I know it does with IE under Windows) I used a font from Google Font API, and it does not seem to be consistent across different web browsers / OS'es;
1. What kind of difficulties did you have in switching from Sweave / pgfSweave / whatever-Sweave to **knitr**?
1. Do you like the idea of putting R code / output in a shaded frame in LaTeX? is the default shading (`rgb(.97, .97, .97)`) too dark or too light? how about the highlighting theme?
1. Have you ever tried to hack at Sweave? I'd love to listen to your stories;
1. What else do you expect from **knitr**?

Feel free to file a bug report in [the issues page](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues) if you find any problems or have any suggestions. I appreciate your efforts in making this **knitr** package even neater!
