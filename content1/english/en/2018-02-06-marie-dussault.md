Honestly, I rarely expect users to read the full documentation of my software packages for a number of reasons: (1) They may be busy; (2) Technical documentation can be dry and boring; (3) I wish software is intuitive enough so that users don't have to read the documentation; (4) I intentionally lower my expectation so that I wouldn't be too disappointed when I discover that a certain reader didn't read the documentation at all (e.g., it is hard not to feel heartbroken when a **blogdown** user doesn't even bother to read the first chapter of the book).

Write, as if no one would read it.

I was very happy to learn that [Marie Dussault](https://twitter.com/londonaesthetik/status/960895191992463365) actually finished reading the **blogdown** book in three hours. That was beyond my expectation, and will give me more motivation to work on my future software documentation.

BTW, I found [Jesse Maegan](https://twitter.com/kierisi/status/960879081553387520)'s description very amusing: "I'll tweak this - OMG WHY IS MY SITE BROKEN?" That immediately brought this GIF to my mind:

Again BTW, can you imagine [how amazing my co-author Alison is](https://twitter.com/apreshill/status/960879856413163520)?!
