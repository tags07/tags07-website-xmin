Tom Elliott posted a calendar plot of bus delay times [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tomelliottnz/status/958455527524130817). My first reaction was, these little area graphs look like cats! Five seconds later, I saw 
Luis A. Apiolaza's reply: They look like cats! All of a sudden, [Murphy's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law) came to my mind, and I have got Yihui's Cat-looking Law. For the record, the full text of the law is:

> Anything that can look like cats in your eyes, will look like cats in some other people's eyes.

P.S. Below are two of my favorite cats pictures.
