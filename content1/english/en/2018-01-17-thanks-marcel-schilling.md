A few days ago Frank asked [a **bookdown** question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/48247787/559676) on Stack Overflow ([many thanks](/en/2017/08/so-gh-email/) for asking on Stack Overflow first!), and also posted it to Github ([rstudio/bookdown#515](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/issues/515)) last night. When I woke up this morning, it had been answered by Marcel Schilling (of course, I'll [award 500 points](/en/2017/12/so-bounties/)). It seems he could read my mind, because he said this in the Github issue:

> If your problem is solved, don't forget to close this issue.

Yes! The fewer open issues I see, the happier I feel. Every single Github issue requires a decision: Should I fix it? Answer it? Ignore it? Ask for more info? Close it? When I go through a large number of Github issues, I have to constantly switch channels in my mind, and I guess you all know the initial friction when you are about to tackle a new problem (you need time to warm up --- perhaps take a look at Twitter, have some snacks, and so on, and then take a deep breath, only to find it is already 5pm). In my busy (or lazy) days, I almost wish I could pay you to close your own issues if they are not really big deal.

Marcel also pointed out that one could help edit the source of the **bookdown** book and send a pull request if the book is not clear. Joyful tears were rolling down my face. I love people who know how to edit files online on Github. I, just, love, them.

Thanks, Marcel. You made my day better.
