Ever since [I joked at rstudio::conf(2019)](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/pagedown-creating-beautiful-pdfs-with-r-markdown-and-css) that the government shutdown was [not my fault](https://twitter.com/apreshill/status/1086305302964813827), people have remembered it so well that they think of me whenever they seen anything "down". In this post, and just for fun, I'm going to collect those "down" incidents for which I'm not responsible: 

- [Malcolm Barrett](https://twitter.com/malco_barrett/status/1139975654772891648): is @xieyihui working on a new project and everyone knows about it but me?

- [Emil Hvitfeldt](https://twitter.com/Emil_Hvitfeldt/status/1225908019176734726): I wonder if @xieyihui is up to something great
