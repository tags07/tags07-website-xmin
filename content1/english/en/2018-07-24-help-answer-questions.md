Earlier this year, I said "[nothing feels better than someone else answering questions for me](/en/2018/01/thanks-marcel-schilling/)". I feel happier and happier as I see more and more people answer questions that would otherwise fall on my shoulders. Just three recent examples to show how good I feel when I wake up in the morning only to find some questions have been answered on Github (and better, closed):

- [Adjusting font-size in ioslides using R Markdown](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown-book/issues/30)

- [Customizing logos added to each slide | R Markdown ioslides](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown-book/issues/31)

- [`bookdown`/`rmarkdown`/`knitr`: Non-code sequential processing howto?](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/issues/602)

Some people have been helping me so frequently on Github and Stack Overflow that I can easily list their names: Marcel Schilling, Michael Harper, Ralf Stubner, Christophe Dervieux, and TC Zhang (apologies if I omitted other frequent helpers -- I'm pretty bad at remembering people's names).

So if/when you find my work useful, please remember this nice crowd of helpers who liberated my productivity.
