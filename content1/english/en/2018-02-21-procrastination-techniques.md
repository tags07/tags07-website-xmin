After I published the [crisis post](/en/2018/02/career-crisis), I have received a lot of helpful and warm feedback (I'm hoping to summarize them someday), and also seen several discussions and comments on Twitter. There was a thread that was unexpected to me, because people started to [share procrastination techniques](https://twitter.com/Voovarb/status/964564048397221888) (apparently these methods won't work with [Alastair Rushworth](https://twitter.com/rushworth_a/status/964575755614253058)).

Someone even pointed out a website [Corrupt-a-File.net](https://corrupt-a-file.net). I hope this website was just kidding.
