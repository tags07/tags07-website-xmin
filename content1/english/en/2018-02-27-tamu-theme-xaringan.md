Three days ago, Nan-Hung [contributed a TAMU (Texas A&M) theme](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/pull/115) to the **xaringan** package, following [my call for new **xaringan** themes](/en/2017/10/xaringan-themes/) last year. It was a good and relatively simple example of how **xaringan** CSS themes work. He also [summarized](https://nanhung.rbind.io/slide/tamu-slide-template.html#14) other currently available themes in **xaringan** in his example. It is great that people are starting to realize the [power of CSS](https://slides.yihui.org/2018-blogdown-rstudio-conf-Yihui-Xie.html#33). I'm definitely looking forward to more wonderful themes.
