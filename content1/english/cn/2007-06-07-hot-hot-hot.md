The weather in Beijing is hard to endure. Thirty-six centigrade degrees. ft!

So let's tell cold jokes:

> An "excellent" student was asked to answer a question raised by his teacher, and the question was very very very difficult. However, he stood up and asked, "Should I answer it in Chinese or in English?" His classmates admired him so much because almost nobody was able to give an answer (even a Chinese answer). The teacher thought for a while, and preferred a Chinese answer, thus the student gave this one:
> 
> "Bu Zhi Dao."
> 
> The teacher was a little bit amazed and changed his mind. And this time, the student said:
> 
> "I don't know."
