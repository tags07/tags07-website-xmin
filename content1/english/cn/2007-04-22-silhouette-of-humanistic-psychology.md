When I was thumbing through the book "The Practice of Management" by Peter F. Drucker after my lunch in the office, I just realized again the importance of humanism. In this aspect, [Abraham Maslow](http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/maslow.html) had played a critical role in the development of humanistic psychology. The basic idea is fairly simple: not a single individual should be ignored. Well, simple as it is, there're still many individuals being ignored by managers. On the other hand, responsibility, rather than power, must be emphasized. Sure, this viewpoint will influence the development of an enterprise in the long run.
