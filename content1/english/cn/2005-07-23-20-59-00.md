Mental images of happy times would appear when silently sitting in the room...

Imaging that I, we, they, or all of us would be happy for good...

Sometimes it's just too naive whereas naive dreams are also precious...

Such a fresh day with raindrops falling and breeze blowing...

Ordinary as a trifle may be, sometimes it could remind you of something not trivial...

So it is with the rain today...
