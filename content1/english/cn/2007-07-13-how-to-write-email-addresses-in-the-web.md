What I hate most about the internet is the spam email, so I pay much attention to how to write my email address in the public web pages. Of course we cannot write it directly, because it'll be easily searched out by those spam-makers and the consequence will be terrible.

Therefore, sometimes I write `xieyihui (a) gmail.com`, sometimes `xieyihui AT gmail.com`, or `xieyihui # gmail.com`, but what I like most is `x@y` with `x=xieyihui & y=gmail.com`.
