I have to admit that I'm far from smart or clever, and I believe perhaps more torture will come along with being smarter because I'm not yet the smartest. I always require nothing too much. I never regard myself as a somebody and dream to be a real somebody, but instead I'm just a commonplace nobody dreaming to be somebody.

It's cruel, again. Really.
