It's said that tomorrow there will be a certain "VIP" (sorry, but I always relate this acronym to Very Important Pig -_-!!) coming to our school, so we need to be well prepared. Today I saw many senseless disguises: cleaners cleaning the floor, students tidying up their rooms... So, when that VIP enter our school, he/she will see a pleasant campus, "Hmm... RUC is good...", he/she nods, with our leaders smiling beside him/her.

Actually what I hate are not VIPs, but I do hate inefficiencies caused by disguising.
