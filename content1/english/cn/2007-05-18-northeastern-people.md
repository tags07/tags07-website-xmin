This evening Xiaoye LU from the China Asset Management Co.,Ltd invited me to supper and at last we were too full to come back because we ate too much...

He is from the northeast and 10 years elder than me. This guy is very extroverted and enthusiastic. I suddenly remembered some words describing northeastern people: dong bei ren dou shi huo lei feng. But somebody modified the last word just for kidding: dong bei ren dou shi huo lei gong. I believe this is reasonable, for northeastern people like talking aloud. (While LU doesn't talk so loudly)
