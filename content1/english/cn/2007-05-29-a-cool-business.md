This evening when I was having supper with some people from the China Customs, one of them told us a strange business: some guys in Canada split icebergs in the Arctic Ocean and bind the big block of ice to their ship, then drag it to Japan to sell it as pure fresh water; because the ice block is extremely big, it won't completely melt on the way (in the Pacific Ocean) -- when they reach Japan, they can sell the rest of the ice at a very high price.

Isn't it a cool business? (Maybe even "cold"?)

BTW, I'm ultimately temporarily free now. 10000 years old, 10000 years old, 10000 10000 years old!
