This morning there was a ceremony for the beginning of the new term, and when I was listening to the speech of Teng Yuan, suddenly I felt the speed of time. Age is featured in words when speaking, I said to myself.

Soon there'll be an English test this afternoon in order to decide whether we need to study English next term (just like _discriminant analysis_), but I'm reluctant to make any preparations or reviews. I dislike examinations, especially English exams and computer exams. Never have I thought those exams could test the real level of a person.
