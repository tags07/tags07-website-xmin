Recently I have been negotiating with SCIGE Information Technology Co., LTD on some training-course issues, and I introduced R to them when talking about training courses of EViews. It seems that they're interested. So perhaps I've just found an intermediate by which I can popularize the domestic applications of R. Sure, there's still a long way to go, and I'm too clear that the greatest obstacle is the knowledge of statistics rather than statistical packages themselves. 

Besides, use EViews, SPSS, SAS and Stata to make money, and R for research. It's true.
