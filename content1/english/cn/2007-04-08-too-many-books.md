It seems that I haven't been here for quite a long time... Err... Does this poor space smell moldy now?  I decide to write a few words again from now on.  

Recently I found there were really too many books waiting for me. Actually the number is more than 60. I know neither God nor Bodhisattva would help me because they are merely busy telling us to be good boys and girls instead of generalized linear models or structural equation modeling.

Anyway, I've got a far better understanding on GLM now. I'm clear it's late for a postgraduate, but I'm trying my best.
