But there's still too much work to do :-(

By the way, yesterday I registered a domain name for myself: <http://yihui.org>. I plan to build a genuine personal website during this summer holiday and drop all my other websites such as blogs or spaces. I never have a sense of safety (or satisfaction) when using services which do not really belong to myself. Now you may visit `http://blog.yihui.org` for this MSN space, but the [homepage](http://www.yihui.org) is not available currently.
