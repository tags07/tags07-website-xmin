I believe many people have quite vague recognitions of the "directions" for life, and I also believe "better late than never" is nothing but a magnificent excuse, for late is late.

Usually I put great emphasis on my directions and my little aims are very clear (while the greatest aim is not that easy to decide). I know what I don't understand, where I shouldn't waste efforts, and what I don't want. I often try to balance advantages and disadvantages. Everything can be balanced except time, so the critical problem lies in the management of time. My logic is always simple, just as what I think about statistics models. (For example, I summarize the whole subject of machine learning as far as I know to only one word: grid)
