Suddenly a simple law came to my mind: sometimes you think you are `_____`, but the fact turns out to be you are not.

For example, sometimes you think you are important, but... Or you think you are great, but... Or wise, but... Or useful, but...

It's simple, because everything you think is subjective. In your brain, there are almost no facts. I must declare that actually I have no interest in such philosophy.
