对不起了各位，谢某需要归隐一段时间了，关于Blog，过些日子再说吧。也许以后也不在这里写了，一辉大人最近在考虑自己建站的事情，准备策划一项大阴谋。多谢各位GGJJDDMM一直以来的捧场！

> Hello darkness my old friend.  
> I've come to talk with you again.  
> Because a vision softly creeping  
> Left its seeds while I was sleeping.  
> And the vision that was planted in my brain  
> Still remains with the sound of silence  
> In restless dreams I walk alone  
> Narrow streets of cobble stone  
> Beneath the hallo of a street lamp,  
> I turned my collar to the cold and damp  
> When my eyes were stabbled by the flash of a neon light  
> That split the night  
> And touched the sound of silence 

> And in the naked night I saw ten thousand people may be more  
> People talking without speaking hearing without listening  
> People writing songs that voices never share  
> And no one dare disturb the sound of silence  
> "Fool" said I "you do not know  
> Silence like a cancer grows  
> Hear my words that I might teach you  
> Take my arms that I might reach you  
> But my words like silent rain-drops fell  
> And echo-ed in the wells of silence  
> And the people bow and prayed  
> to the neon God they made  
> And the sign flash out its warning  
> In the words that it was forming  
> And the sings said "The words of the prophers are  
> written the subway walls and tenement halls"  
> And whispered in the sounds of silence
