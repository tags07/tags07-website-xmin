This evening our teacher Mr. Simple (?) let us discuss for ourselves. So I just began to tell jokes -- as I always do when Mr. Simple asks us to discuss some problems.

One of my stories was:

> Have you heard the story in which the little dog said "Yes" but the little pig said "No"?

Both Ms. Fan and Ms. Wang said "No" -- these two girls were very quick in response. Ms. Ding thought for a long long time -- hmm... it seemed that she was a little bit slow in action -- at last she didn't answer me.

Hey, have you ever heard this story? See what see? Say you! (kan shenme kan? shuo ni ne!)
