Frankly speaking, I don't like Renmin University at all, but I love our school (the School of Statistics). Occasionally I go to the BBS of RUC and see what they're discussing, and my impression of that BBS is just a place of _endless _quarrels day after day. Every now and then I can see selfish guys quarrelling for their own interests -- they just cannot stand their profits being violated. It's a great shame for these so-called "educated" students.

Why don't we think more of others?
