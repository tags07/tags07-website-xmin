It's said that time flies like an arrow, but for me perhaps it's not true...

Long time as it is, there were also many unforgettbale things happened...

Over and over again, in a certain silent night they'd show up in my mind...

Vacant and clear, faraway and near, joyful and sorrowful, lost and found...

Enjoy life! I say to myself, ignoring past the bitterness I've experienced...

Observing the silver lining every time we get lost in the heavy clouds...

.

Sharing, Sacrificing, Screaming, Sealing, Sensing, Singing, in September...
