[GNU](http://www.gnu.org/) is really a toooooo great project!

I love this head, though I don't know what on earth is this animal... (a goat or a bull?)  

This evening I spent several hours on the study of TEXMACS, and there were many surprising features. Actually I just wanted to make some transparencies for a presentation next week, but PowerPointÂ® is too ugly for me, especially when we use mathematical formulae (the quality is hard to endure!). In contrast, TeX/LaTeX is much better, but it's a little bit inconvenient, so at last I chose TeXmacs. ([This is what I made in TeXmacs](https://github.com/downloads/yihui/yihui.github.com/Bootstrap-2007-Yihui-Xie.pdf))
