Take it easy, and ultimately there'll be a happy ending; just like a fairy tale -- "And they (usually the Prince & Princess) live happily ever after".

I remembered a joke just now:

> A teacher was very angry with one of his students because of that student's English composition: it was started with a story about the Prince and Princess long long ago (looks like a good composition, huh?), but the next sentence was, "The Prince asked the Princess, 'Can you speak Chinese?', and the Princess answered, 'Yes!', so they began to talk in Chinese", therefore, the rest part of the composition was completely written in Chinese -______-!!!! Orz...
