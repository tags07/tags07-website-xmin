Suddenly I realized it was not strange for a rabbit to fish with radish as baits, because rabbits just eat radish. Thus they think fish eats radish too. But fish will regard rabbits as fools.

Background of these words:  

> A rabbit was fishing in a river on the 1st day but got no fish... The rabbit was fishing in the river on the 2nd day but got no fish... 3rd day... nth day... And on the evening of this day, when the rabbit was just about to leave the river and go home, a fish jumped out of the river angrily, "YOU FOOL! Don't feed me with radish again! Or I'll beat you!"
