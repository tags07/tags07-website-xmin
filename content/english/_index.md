My name is Yihui Xie. You can know more about me on the [homepage](/) and my [vitae](../vitae/). This blog is about statistics, R, graphics, life, and fun, with a special focus on R. I often update my old posts (even after years) to correct errors and remove outdated information, so please don't take everything for granted. All opinions expressed here are my own, and I don't represent anyone else such as my employer.

## Contact me

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/yihui) (where I'm active almost every day) or Twitter [@xieyihui](http://twitter.com/xieyihui) (I only read Twitter once a week, and usually don't answer questions there). You may subscribe to the RSS feed of [blog posts](../index.xml) or [all comments](https://yihui.disqus.com/latest.rss) to stay tuned. I don't like formality, so it is not necessary to call me "Dr Xie" when you email me or introduce me to your friends. I'm a software engineer, so please don't call me professor.

I don't prefer people asking me questions about open-source packages by private emails. It is not practical for me to answer all of them (not even for the packages that I maintain). Emails often make me feel stressful in recent years, and I'm close to the point of [email bankruptcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_bankruptcy) from time to time. I've reached "Inbox Zero" only once in my life. Usually I have about 100 emails in my inbox to which I haven't been able to reply.

Please don't get me wrong---I do like questions, but I prefer seeing questions about open-source packages (like R) posted on Stack Overflow or RStudio Community, instead of in my inbox. Please feel free to email me the link to your question if nobody has answered you after a few days. Knowledge should be open to the public whenever possible, and I'd like to use emails only for _private_ conversations (more explanations in [this post](/en/2017/08/so-gh-email/)). BTW, when you say you have "[a quick question](/en/2018/07/quick-questions/)", please make sure it is really quick, so I don't have to doubt if I'm too dumb. If you are not sure, please feel free to say that you have a question.

In short, I wish I could help you, but practically I cannot do it privately. I will truly appreciate it if you could use public resources before trying private emails or messages.
